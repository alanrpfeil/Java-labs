    <h3>
        Making an ArrayList of People
    </h3>
    <p>
        We will practice using more Arraylist to create another list of objects. This time it will be a list of person objects, ie people.
        First you will have to complete the class definition of a Person object. Then by utilizing an arrayList keep track of all the people 
        listed in different files. 
    </p>

    <div class="task">
        <h4>Task 2: Person.java</h4>

        <p>
            Take a look at Person.java. It has 3 private variables: name, age and location. Fill-in or fix all the methods inside this Class.

        </p>
    </div>

	

    <div class="task">
        <h4>Task 3: People.java</h4>
        <p> This program works by reading information about each person inside the file. There are three traits for each person: name, age and location. You need to create a Person object pointed to by people array for each line in the input file. 
        The expected output is created by calling accessor methods on each person object. You job is to just change the part that says fill-in. The rest of the code is there to make testing easier and to make sure you do
everything in an expected way. The program should runs as is but you will see it prints out no useful information. </p>
 people1.txt has the following features: 
<ul>
<li>First entry is the name of the person (one word)</li>
<li>Second entry is the age (one number)</li>
<li>Third entry is the location (one word)</li></ul>
<br>

people2.txt has more complicated data format:

<ul><li>Tab delimited </li>
<li>First entry can be multiple words separated by space </li>
<li>Second entry is a number for age</li>
<li>Last entry can also be multiple words for location</li></ul>

		<ol>
        <li>Give the method call to useDelimiter() to use tab character. </li>
        <li>Do you need next() or nextLine() to handle multiple words?</li>
        </ol>

<h4>Task 4: IORunner.java</h4>
<p> Put in appropriate calls to People.java so it prints out exactly as the Expected output for each of the files. </p>
