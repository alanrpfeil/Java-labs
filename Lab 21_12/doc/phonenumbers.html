    <h3>
        String Manipulation
    </h3>
    <p>
        The task of this program is to read numbers from data/Phone.txt and display appropriately. 
        Right now the code just prints out the fileâ€™s contents line by line. You should create an arrayList of every phone number
        and return that to the caller. We have created <code>output</code> variable for you to insert each number into.
        
        So we will go through what you are given first. You can see the format of the phone numbers are the following:
	<ol> 
	<li>Country code is before the first dash (1-3 digits)</li>
	<li>Between the first and second dashes are the city code (or area code) </li>
	<li>After the second dash is the phone number
	<ol type="a">
	
		<li>5-8 digits</li>
		<li>May or may not have dash in the middle</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	Your job is to separate the phone number String into 3 parts and print out as shown in the expected output.
    </p>

        <pre>
		1	String filename = "data/phone.txt"; 
		2	ArrayList<String> output = new ArrayList<String>();

		3	try {
		4		Scanner input = new Scanner ( new FileReader(filename) );

		5		while (input.hasNextLine()) {
		6		System.out.println(input.nextLine());

		7	input.close();

        <ol>
            <li>What datatype is each arraylist element that got created in Line 2?
            </li>
            <li>How many objects are created in line 4 (Scanner input ... ) ? 
            </li>
            <li>How many pointers are used in line 4? List them:
            </li>
            <li>What is the difference between next() and nextLine()? 
            </li>
            <li>Why does line 5 use nextLine? Is there a delimiting character that will make next() be the same as nextLine()? 
            </li>
            <li>What is a NoFileFoundException? When will this occur?
            </li>
            <li>What is a NoSuchElementException? When will this occur?
            </li>
            <li>What does useDelimiter() method do for a Scanner object?
            </li>
            <li>List the two delimiters for phone numbers given in Phone.txt:
            </li>
            <li>What is being returned in Line 13? Is it a pointer or an object?
            </li>
        </ol>
